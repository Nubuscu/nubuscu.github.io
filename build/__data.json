Hearing the lyics came later.\n\nIn a similar vein, there's a lot of nuanced, pretty tones you can get from a clean guitar that distortion blows away.\nSure, there's some loss of clarity but that's an artistic choice. I'd argue that screams are more emotive.\n\nAwakened was _the_ album that got me into metalcore. A Greater Foundation was where I started, so that might be a good place to start too.\nTriptych era DH is kinda just shouty with some clean vocals, so that's fairly easy to understand.\nOr any hard(er) rock where there's a screamed bridge or harsh backing vocals.
