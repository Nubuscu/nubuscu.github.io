Screaming, extreme vocals, gutturals, growls, pig squeals, etc. Not clean singing.\n\nFor me, it was an acquired taste, and not all vocalists are the same. I can't say I catch every word that's said but I don't exactly do that anyway. For the most part, I just consider vocals to be another instrument.\n\nIn a similar vein, there's a lot of nuanced, pretty tones you can get from a clean guitar that distortion blows away. Sure, there's some loss of clarity but that's an artistic choice.\n\nAwakened was _the_ album that got me into metalcore. A Greater Foundation was where I started, so that might be a good place to start too.\nTriptych era DH is kinda just shouty with some clean vocals, so that's fairly easy to understand.\nOr any hard(er) rock where there's a screamed bridge or harsh backing vocals.
