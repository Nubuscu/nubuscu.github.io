Learn to play a few rage against the machine songs\n1. Stumble upon a Zack de le Rocha feature on a Run The Jewels album\n1. See a Fantano video on Death Grips and try out Exmilitary\n1. Let the various recommendation engines do the rest\n\nI tend towards stuff with good beats/production and complex or funny lyricism.\nSome of the more abrasive beats border on the fuzzy, hardcore punk elements of other things I like.\n\ne.g.\n- anything RTJ - 2 and 3 are my favourites. El-P's solo stuff is good too\n- Danny Brown - Ain't it Funny\n- Death Grips - Exmilitary (the EP is a free download), particularly Takyon\n"}]}},{node:{id:"12884901890",name:"Fuzz",includes:[{id:"189",name:"Lifeblood",by:[{id:"4294967488",name:"Brand of Sacrifice"}]},{id:"123",name:"Absolution",by:[{id:"4294967422",name:"Muse"}]},{id:"74",name:"Whales and Leeches",by:[{id:"4294967342",name:"Red Fang"}]},{id:"82",name:"Fantasy Empire",by:[{id:"4294967379",name:"Lightning Bolt"}]},{id:"25",name:"Unlikely",by:[{id:"4294967320",name:"Far From Alaska"}]},{id:"47",name:"Murder the Mountains",by:[{id:"4294967342",name:"Red Fang"}]},{id:"75",name:"No One Goes To Heaven",by:[{id:"4294967300",name:"Left Behind"}]},{id:"33",name:"Crimson Riders",by:[{id:"4294967328",name:"Bokassa"}]},{id:"19",name:"Blackjazz",by:[{id:"4294967314",name:"Shining"}]},{id:"163",name:"Sound Awake",by:[{id:"4294967462",name:"Karnivool"}]},{id:"184",name:"Existential Void Guardian",by:[{id:"4294967483",name:"Conan"}]},{id:"7",name:"Mutants",by:[{id:"4294967302",name:"Mutoid Man"}]}],reviewedBy:[{id:"8589934594",name:"The fuzz",body:"\nOverdrive, distortion, and fuzz are all (typically) guitar effects along the same spectrum - push more signal through the amplifier than you should and see what it does.\nNow that it's an established pattern, there's plenty of amps built for it or pedals to accomplish the same effect.\n\nThere's plenty of overlap but in general, overdrive is relatively tasteful, distortion is aggressive, and fuzz is anywhere between a wall of noise and pretending to be a synthesizer.\n\nIt crops up in slower, doom or stoner rock/metal subgenres for the former and electronic-heavy subgenres for the latter.\n\nRecommendations:\n- The whole Mutants album, start with Demons.\n- Muse - Hysteria, obviously\n- Karnivool - Goliath, Darkglass made a pedal out of that tone.\n- Conan - Volt Thrower\n"}]}},{node:{id:"12884901891",name:"The Gym",includes:[{id:"13",name:"Terrasite",by:[{id:"4294967308",name:"Cattle Decapitation"}]},{id:"5",name:"Seeing Hell",by:[{id:"4294967300",name:"Left Behind"}]},{id:"199",name:"Laugh Tracks",by:[{id:"4294967296",name:"Knocked Loose"}]},{id:"78",name:"Kostolom",by:[{id:"4294967375",name:"Slaughter to Prevail"}]},{id:"75",name:"No One Goes To Heaven",by:[{id:"4294967300",name:"Left Behind"}]},{id:"28",name:"Oh What The Future Holds",by:[{id:"4294967312",name:"Fit For An Autopsy"}]},{id:"57",name:"Life of Crime",by:[{id:"4294967353",name:"Goolagoon"}]},{id:"254",name:"All Hope Is Gone",by:[]},{id:"186",name:"Absolute",by:[{id:"4294967485",name:"Kublai Khan TX"}]},{id:"17",name:"Hellbound",by:[{id:"4294967312",name:"Fit For An Autopsy"}]},{id:"62",name:"Whitechapel",by:[{id:"4294967319",name:"Whitechapel"}]}],reviewedBy:[{id:"8589934595",name:"Lift heavy rock make sad voice go away",body:"\nAt some point when I was riding skateboards, I figured out I would skate faster if I listened to angry music.\n\nThis seems to have translated into what I listen to at the gym.\n"}]}},{node:{id:"12884901892",name:"Atmosphere",includes:[{id:"49",name:"May Our Chambers Be Full",by:[{id:"4294967345",name:"Thou"},{id:"4294967344",name:"Emma Ruth Rundle"}]},{id:"170",name:"A Tear in the Fabric of Life",by:[{id:"4294967296",name:"Knocked Loose"}]},{id:"67",name:"Exercises in Futility",by:[{id:"4294967364",name:"Mg≈Ça"}]},{id:"138",name:"The Great Collapse",by:[{id:"4294967312",name:"Fit For An Autopsy"}]},{id:"3",name:"Litourgiya",by:[{id:"4294967298",name:"Batushka"}]},{id:"22",name:"The Dark Pool",by:[{id:"4294967317",name:"Thornhill"}]},{id:"88",name:"Ohms",by:[{id:"4294967385",name:"Deftones"}]},{id:"211",name:"I Let It in and It Took Everything",by:[{id:"4294967510",name:"Loathe"}]},{id:"2",name:"Rashomon",by:[{id:"4294967297",name:"Ibaraki"}]},{id:"11",name:"Where Owls Know My Name",by:[{id:"4294967306",name:"Rivers of Nihil"}]}],reviewedBy:[{id:"8589934596",name:"heaviness: atmosphere",body:"\n\n"}]}},{node:{id:"12884901893",name:"Screaming",includes:[{id:"105",name:"The Triptych",by:[{id:"4294967404",name:"Demon Hunter"}]},{id:"147",name:"Slave to Nothing",by:[{id:"4294967384",name:"Fit For A King"}]},{id:"194",name:"Constellations",by:[{id:"4294967493",name:"August Burns Red"}]},{id:"108",name:"III",by:[{id:"4294967407",name:"Maylene And The Sons Of Disaster"}]},{id:"130",name:"Awakened",by:[{id:"4294967429",name:"As I Lay Dying"}]},{id:"273",name:"thegodmachine",by:[]},{id:"115",name:"Welcome To The Masquerade",by:[{id:"4294967412",name:"Thousand Foot Krutch"}]},{id:"102",name:"Wasting Light",by:[{id:"4294967401",name:"Foo Fighters"}]}],reviewedBy:[{id:"8589934597",name:"How to not hate the vocals",body:"\nOne of the complaints about metal I hear from non-fans seems to be the harsh vocals.\nOr whatever you want to call it. Screaming, extreme vocals, gutturals, growls, pig squeals, etc. Not clean singing.\n\nFor me, it was an acquired taste, and not all vocalists are the same.\nI can't say I catch every word that's said but I don't exactly do that with things that get radio play anyway.\nAt least to begin, I just considered vocals to be another instrument, and I was mostly listening for those anyway. Hearing the lyics came later.\n\nIn a similar vein, there's a lot of nuanced, pretty tones you can get from a clean guitar that distortion blows away.\nSure, there's some loss of clarity but that's an artistic choice. I'd argue that screams are more emotive.\n\nAwakened was _the_ album that got me into metalcore. A Greater Foundation was where I started, so that might be a good place to start too.\nTriptych era DH is kinda just shouty with some clean vocals, so that's fairly easy to understand.\nOr any hard(er) rock where there's a screamed bridge or harsh backing vocals.
